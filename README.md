Harvard
=======

The repo that contains all the code I developped during my internship at Harvard University on the fast simulation of cell division.
The code is written and directly executable in MATLAB. All the code that is outside the "Sebastien Besson" directory has been written by me. A complete report on this work can be found in the "Rapport directory".

Please do contact me for any use or edition of the code.

Thank you,
Antoine
