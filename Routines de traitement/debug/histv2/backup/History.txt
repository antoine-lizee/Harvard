These three functions have been part of the "histv2" project, in chronological order. v2<v3<v4.
The final version, which has been finally renanmed officially "histv2" is the file histv4.
The difference between these three files lies in the way to treat the bundaries of the sample :
histv2 considers only the points whose window are completely included in the range of the data. The reduced interval is then filled with points spaced with L/b.
histv3 considers all the b points and count always with the big window width, even when the window sticks out the boundaries. 
histv4 considers all the b points + renormalizes the extreme points with the ratio : (big window width)/(real window width).
